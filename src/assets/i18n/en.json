    "SECTION_TITLE": "Our Story",
    "PARAGRAPH_1": "In 1973, the family company Nea Dimitra was founded by Nikolaos Lazaridis. Its headquarters were located in Skydra, known as one of Greece's largest centers for fruit production and export. On the fertile plains of Macedonia, near the charming Pella and nestled among the green mountains and roaring waterfalls of Edessa, the company flourished. In these perfect natural conditions, we cultivated numerous varieties of juicy fruits, each one capturing the essence of the ancient Greek sun.",
    "PARAGRAPH_2": "Thanks to its dynamic growth, in 1991 the company was transformed into Eliza Fruit S.A. Lazaridis Bros, constantly opening up to new markets and expanding its reach.",
    "VALUES_TITLE": "Our Values",
    "VALUES_PARAGRAPH_1": "Our company is a family of people united by a deep passion for fresh fruits and vegetables. Over 46 years of operation, we have learned to pay attention to every detail to ensure our customers' experiences are exceptional. We deeply believe that Eliza is not just another company, it's a family where everyone makes every effort to bring the highest quality fruits and vegetables to our consumers' tables.",
    "VALUES_PARAGRAPH_2": "We are committed to delivering products of the highest quality while caring for the environment in which they are grown and processed. We put a lot of heart into building long-term relationships with our growers, because for us, people and human relationships are more important than profit. We are also dedicated to the principles of fair trade.",
